format characters
%r is a very useful one. It’s like saying “print this no matter what.”

EX_06

Python knows you want something to be a string when you put either "
(double-quotes) or ' (single- quotes) around the text.

You simply put the formatted variables in the string, and then a % (percent)
character, followed by the variable. The only catch is that if you want
multiple formats in your string to print multiple variables, you need to put
them inside ( ) (parentheses) separated by , (commas).

y = "Those who know %s and those who %s." % (binary, do_not)

What is the difference between %r and %s?
We use %r for debugging, since it displays the “raw” data of the variable, but
we use %s and others for displaying to users.

Why do you put ' (single- quotes) around some strings and not others?
Mostly it’s because of style, but I’ll use a single- quote inside a string that
has double-quotes.

EX_07

[line] longer than 80 characters, ... in Python is bad 
style.

EX_08

Should I use %s or %r for formatting?
You should use %s and only use %r for getting debugging information about
something. The %r will give you the “raw programmer’s” version of variable,
also known as the “representation.”

Why do I have to put quotes around “one” but not around True or False?
That’s because Python recognizes True and False as keywords representing the
concept of true and false. If you put quotes around them, then they are turned
into strings and won’t work right.

EX_09

Why do the \n newlines not work when I use %r?
That’s how %r formatting works; it prints it the way you wrote it (or close to
it). It’s the “raw” format for debugging.

Escape Sequences
This is the list of all the escape sequences Python supports.

Escape      What it does.
\\          Backslash (\)
\'          Single- quote (')
\"          Double- quote (")
\a          ASCII bell (BEL)
\b          ASCII backspace (BS)
\f          ASCII formfeed (FF)
\n          ASCII linefeed (LF)
\N{name}    Character named name in the Unicode database (Unicode only)
\r ASCII    carriage return (CR)
\t ASCII    horizontal tab (TAB)
\uxxxx      Character with 16- bit hex value xxxx (Unicode only)
\Uxxxxxxxx  Character with 32- bit hex value xxxxxxxx (Unicode only)
\v ASCII    vertical tab (VT)
\ooo        Character with octal value oo
\xhh        Character with hex value hh

EX_11

NOTE: Notice that we put a , (comma) at the end of each print line. This is so
that print doesn’t end the line with a new line character and go to the next
line.

How do I get a number from someone so I can do math?
That’s a little advanced, but try x = int(raw_input()), which gets the number as
a string from raw_input() then converts it to an integer using int().

EX_12

In Terminal, where you normally run python to run your scripts, type pydoc
raw_input. Read what it says. If you’re on Windows try
python -m pydoc raw_input instead.

EX_13

1    from sys import argv

On line 1 we have what’s called an “import.” This is how you add features to
your script from the Python feature set. Rather than give you all the features
(modules) at once, Python asks you to say what you plan to use. This keeps your
programs small, but it also acts as documentation for other programmers who read
your code later.

3    script, first, second, third = argv

Line 3 “unpacks” argv so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets
assigned to four variables you can work with: script, first, second, and third.
This may look strange, but “unpack” is probably the best word to describe what
it does. It just says, “Take whatever is in argv, unpack it, and assign it to
all these variables on the left in order.”

Are the command line arguments strings?
Yes, they come in as strings, even if you typed numbers on the command line. Use
int() to convert them just like with raw_input().

EX_15

What you got back from open is a file, and it’s also got commands you can give
it. You give a ﬁle a command by using the . (dot or period), the name of the
command, and parameters. Just like with open and raw_input. The difference is
that when you say txt.read() you are saying, “Hey txt! Do your read command with
no parameters!”

Have your script also do a close() on the txt and txt_again variables. It’s
important to close ﬁles when you are done with them.

EX_16

...commands (methods/functions) you can give to ﬁles. Here’s the list of
commands I want you to remember:
• close—Closes the ﬁle. Like File- >Save.. in your editor.
• read—Reads the contents of the ﬁle. You can assign the result to a variable.
• readline—Reads just one line of a text ﬁle.
• truncate—Empties the ﬁle. Watch out if you care about the ﬁle.
• write(stuff)—Writes stuff to the ﬁle.

r
Read-only mode. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.
This is the default mode.

r+
Read-write mode. The file pointer will be at the beginning of the file.

w
Write-only mode. Overwrites the file if the file exists. If the file
does not exist, creates a new file for writing.

w+
Read-write mode. Overwrites the existing file if the file exists. If the
file does not exist, creates a new file for reading and writing.

a
Write-only mode. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file
exists. That is, the file is in the append mode. If the file does not exist,
it creates a new file for writing.

a+
Read and write mode. The file pointer is at the end of the file if the file
exists. The file opens in the append mode. If the file does not exist, it
creates a new file for reading and writing.

EX_17

we import another handy command named exists. This returns True if a ﬁle exists,
based on its name in a string as an argument. It returns False if not.

cat It’s an old command that “concatenates” ﬁles together, but mostly it’s just
an easy way to print a ﬁle to the screen.

What does the len() function do?
It gets the length of the string that you pass to it and then returns that as a
number.

indata = open(from_file).read(), which means you 
don’t need to then do in_file.close() when you reach the end of the script. It
should already be closed by Python once that one line runs.

EX_18

Functions do three things:
1. They name pieces of code the way variables name strings and numbers.
2. They take arguments the way your scripts take argv.
3. Using #1 and #2, they let you make your own “mini-scripts” or
“tiny commands.”
You can create a function by using the word def in Python.

Let’s break down the function:
1. First we tell Python we want to make a function using def for “deﬁne.”
2. On the same line as def, we then give the function a name. ...your function
should have a short name that says what it does.
3. Then we tell it we want *args (asterisk args), which is a lot like your argv
parameter but for functions. This has to go inside () parentheses to work.
4. Then we end this line with a : colon and start indenting.
5. After the colon all the lines that are indented four spaces will become
attached to this name.

What’s allowed for a function name?
Just like variable names, anything that doesn’t start with a number and is
letters, numbers, and underscores will work.

What does the * in *args do?
That tells Python to take all the arguments to the function and then put them in
args as a list. It’s like argv that you’ve been using, but for functions. It’s
not normally used too often unless speciﬁcally needed.

EX_19

EX_20

python -m pydoc file

Why are there empty lines between the lines in the ﬁ le?
The readline() function returns the \n that’s in the ﬁle at the end of that
line. This means that print’s \n is being added to the one already returned by
readline(). To change this behavior simply add a , (comma) at the end of print
so that it doesn’t print its own \n.

Why does seek(0) not set the current_line to 0?
First, the seek() function is dealing in bytes, not lines. So that’s going to
the 0 byte (ﬁrst byte) in the ﬁle. Second, current_line is just a variable and
has no real connection to the ﬁle at all. We are manually incrementing it.
